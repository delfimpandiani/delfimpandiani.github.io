# About me
I am Assistant Professor of Cultural Data Analysis at the University of Amsterdam. Based in the Department of Media Studies and the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation. As a scientist, artist, and intersectional humanist, I challenge and play with assumed binaries, like public/private, nature/culture, male/female, and white/colored. Overall, I am committed to producing knowledge that explores how human and non-human agents adapt within the dynamic interplay of technological advancement, societal values, and cultural diversity.


I research what it means to be human in the era of (generative) AI.​ I focus on human-centered and ethical AI, computational cultural analytics, and critical data studies. I emphasize multimodal and explainable software for analyzing cultural heritage data. 


Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering and a M.A. in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge from Università di Bologna  (Italy). I have a Bachelor's degree in Human Evolutionary Biology from Harvard University (U.S.A.), with a minor in Gender and Sexuality Studies.
