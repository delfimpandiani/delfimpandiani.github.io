## Research Interests

**Abstract Labels and the AI Hype in Computer Vision**  
What kinds of subjective, cultural labels are we asking AI models to assign to images? How well do these models work, and what biased visions of the world do they reproduce?

**Situated Ground Truths and Plural Perspectives**  
What are we teaching AI systems as "the truth" to emulate? Technically implementing Donna Haraway's idea of "situated knowledge" for AI: teaching partial, situated perspectives.

**Toxic Memes and Content Moderation**  
Memes and other viral cultural data can spread dangerous messages. But exactly what do we mean with online toxicity, and how are we automating morality and normativity?

**Depictions of the AI/Human Dynamic**  
Are we the chimpanzees of the AI era? I don't think so, but contemporary media is using evolutionary rhetoric to depict AIs as "evolved" human beings.
